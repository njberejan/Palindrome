#Palindrome

This repository is for the Palindrome assignment completed while a student at The Iron Yard in Durham, NC. This is one of the earlier assignments and was the first to be pushed to a GitHub repository. Palindrome.py fulfilled the requirements for the basic mode of the assignment (IE, what was expected to be completed.) Palindrome_Advanced.py has some additional features that were required in the advanced version of the code (essentially, an additional challenge for students who completed the basic mode early and had some extra time to explore more advanced concepts.)

Please run either file with Python3. The program should prompt you to provide a sentence or word, which it will then determine is or is not a palindrome. Enjoy!
